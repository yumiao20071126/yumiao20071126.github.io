# About Me

I am a freshman student in [IIIS, Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Science.

Currently(2025), I am an undergraduate researcher in LLM Agent field supervised by Professor [Yi Wu] at Tsinghua University. My research focuses on LLM and their applictions in different kind of enviroments. 

Before college, I competed in Physics Olympiad during high school and won gold medal in the 40th Chinese Plysics Olympiad (CPhO) in the first semester of the second year of my high school. Afterward, I spent the rest part of my senior high school time in Tsinghua University as a preparatory student to study university-level knowledge in advance. During the preparatory period, I have built a solid foundation in the mathematical principles underlying computer science, deep learning and LLM, as well as proficiency in practical tools such as PyTorch.

Although I am still a beginner, I am eager to explore various opportunities, either in academia or industry. I also enjoy engagin with people who share similar interests and chatting about anything from research ideas to personal experiences. I am looking forward to working with classmates who share the similar research directions during my university years, and making progress together. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!

My resume is linked [here](/files/cv.pdf).
